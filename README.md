- **Assessment Dates:** 10/06/2025 â€“ 22/06/2025
- **Methodology:** [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) v4.2](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) and [NIST SP 800-115](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final)
- **Analyst:** Pakagrong Lebel
- **Lab Creator:** 0x9747

## Summary of Findings

This assessment identified several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities, including:

- **Authenticated Remote Code Execution** (CVE-2020-12256) via template processing and weak credentials (`bolt:boltadmin123`)
- **Weak Authentication Controls** (default credentials, lack of brute-force protection)
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** (admin credentials in public content)
- **Missing Security Headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- **Outdated Software Components** (Bolt CMS 3.7.0, old OpenSSH)

These issues collectively enabled complete system compromise and root-level access. For a full breakdown of vulnerabilities, risk ratings, and technical evidence, please refer to the [attached report](./THM-Bolt-Report-1.pdf)[1].
